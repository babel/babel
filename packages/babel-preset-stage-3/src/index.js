As of v7.0.0-beta.54, we've decided to remove
the official Babel Stage presets. You can find more information
at issue #7770: https://github.com/babel/babel/issues/7770, but
the TL;DR is that it's causing more harm than convenience in that
the preset is always out of date, each change is usually going to
require a major version bump and thus people will be behind,
and it encouraged too many people to opt-in to too many proposals
that they didn't intend to. This is intended to be the last publish
of "@babel/preset-stage-3"

If you want the same configuration as before:

{
  "plugins": [
    "@babel/plugin-syntax-dynamic-import",
    "@babel/plugin-syntax-import-meta",
    ["@babel/plugin-proposal-class-properties", { "loose": false }],
    "@babel/plugin-proposal-json-strings"
  ]
}


If you're using the same configuration across many separate projects,
keep in mind that you can also create your own custom presets with
whichever plugins and presets you're looking to use.

module.exports = function() {
  return {
    plugins: [
      require("@babel/plugin-syntax-dynamic-import"),
      [require("@babel/plugin-proposal-decorators"), { "legacy": true }],
      [require("@babel/plugin-proposal-class-properties"), { "loose": false }],
    ],
    presets: [
      // ...
    ],
  };
};
`);
}
