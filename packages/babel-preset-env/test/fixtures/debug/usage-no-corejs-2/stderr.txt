WARNING: We noticed you're using the `useBuiltIns` option without declaring a core-js version. Currently, we assume version `3.6` when no version is passed. Since this default version will likely change in future versions of Babel, we recommend explicitly setting the core-js version you are using via the `corejs` option.

You should also be sure that the version you pass to the `corejs` option matches the version specified in your `package.json`'s `dependencies` section. If it doesn't, you need to run one of the following commands:

  npm install --save core-js@3.6
  yarn add core-js@3.6
