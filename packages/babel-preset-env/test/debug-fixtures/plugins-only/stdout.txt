Warning, the following targets are using a decimal version:

  node: 7.4

We recommend using a string for minor/patch versions to avoid numbers like 6.10
getting parsed as 6.1, which can lead to unexpected behavior.

@babel/preset-env: `DEBUG` option

Using targets:
{
  "firefox": "52",
  "node": "7.4"
}
