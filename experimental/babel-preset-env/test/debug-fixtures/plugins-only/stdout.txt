Warning, the following targets are using a decimal version:

  node: 7.4

We recommend using a string for minor/patch versions to avoid numbers like 6.10
getting parsed as 6.1, which can lead to unexpected behavior.

@babel/preset-env: `DEBUG` option

Using targets:
{
  "firefox": "52",
  "node": "7.4"
}

Using modules transform: commonjs

Using plugins:
  transform-es2015-destructuring { "firefox":"52" }
  transform-es2015-for-of { "firefox":"52" }
  transform-es2015-function-name { "firefox":"52" }
  transform-es2015-literals { "firefox":"52" }
  syntax-trailing-function-commas { "node":"7.4" }

Using polyfills: No polyfills were added, since the `useBuiltIns` option was not set.
