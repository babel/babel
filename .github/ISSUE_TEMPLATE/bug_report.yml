        - "@babel/cli"
        - "@babel/register or @babel/node"

      description: |
        You must write here the minimal input code necessary to reproduce the bug.
        Even better, you can share a link to the Babel [REPL](https://babel.dev/repl):
        this will make it easier for us to reproduce the issue, and it may help fixing
        the bug sooner.
        If it's not possible to reproduce the bug with a single file, a GitHub Repository
        is also ok.

        **NOTE**: If it's possible that Babel is not correctly loading your config, it's probably because you are using
        `.babelrc`/`package.json` instead of `babel.config.json`.

        **Tip:** You can also run Babel with the environment variable SHOW_CONFIG_FOR=your_file_path to print all configs associated with a path.
