# This file lists tests that are known to produce incorrect results when parsed
# with the babel parser:
#
# - Tests that are expected to parse successfully but for which the babel parser reports
#   a syntax error
# - Tests that contain invalid syntax but for which the babel parser reports no syntax
#   error
#
# Entries should be removed incrementally as the babel parser is improved.
